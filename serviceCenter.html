      If you think that you have an insurance claim on your hands, we have
      the Ullrich Insurance Claims Concierge Program. We will give you
      guidance and do all that we can to help you.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Here are the steps: <br />
      1) If you think that you have a claim, call us immediately and we will
      talk it through with you. <br />
      -Too often, a client will file a claim for something very small. At
      the end of the day, they get a little bit of money from the insurance
      company but their insurance premiums increase even more than what they
      received! We will help you know if you should file a claim or not.
      <br />
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Ultimately, the insurance company will have a claims adjustor who will
      work with you directly. We are always here for you though. We have a
      direct line to the managers of the claims department, so if you need
      us, we can get involved.
